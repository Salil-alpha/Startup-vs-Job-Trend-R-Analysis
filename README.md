# Startup-vs-Job-Trend-R-Analysis

Abstract

In this report, we have considered the expansion of the economy of any country as a major influencer on the behaviors of working individuals. To determine this, we extracted data from various sources like Google Trends, Our World Data, and The World Bank. We extracted trends of ‘startup’ and ‘job’ intensity across different regions and timelines and the human development index GDP of all the nations. The entire data ranged between 2016-2021. We had various statistical and analytical methods applied like regression, ARIMA, correlation, box-plots, and visuals. After going thoroughly, we inferred that there is a negative relationship between the interest in jobs and startups, however, we also found that there is no significant relationship or impact of GDP on driving or influencing jobs and startups. Adding to this, all these are based on some simple tests and analysis, a deep dive can be done with more data to justify the outcomes.


Research Question:

How does economic expansion influence the working behaviour of individuals?


Who does this Impact?

Individuals, corporations, politicians, and even the public at large may be affected in different ways by the analysis's actual results. Some probable results of the research are as follows:
1.	Individuals: The results may have an effect on people by affecting their choices about their careers and how they behave at work. If the data reveals, for instance, that people in developed nations are more likely to have a "job-oriented attitude," then it seems to reason that they would also be more inclined to actively seek out secure, well-paying employment (Kurniawan et al., 2020). Yet, if the study finds that startups are more common in developing nations, then people in such nations may be more likely to see entrepreneurship as a respectable profession.
2.	Companies: The results may have an effect on companies by helping them develop more effective personnel strategies and operational models. Businesses operating in places where there is a higher concentration of startups, for instance, may need to revise their talent acquisition or operational strategy to stay competitive.
3.	Policymakers: The results may have an effect on policymakers by providing new data with which to refine economic policies and plans. For instance, if the findings indicate that developed nations have a higher proportion of people with a "job-oriented attitude," then maybe governments should prioritise the development of permanent, well-paying employment opportunities (Kurniawan et al., 2020). If, on the other hand, policymakers discover that new businesses are more common in emerging nations, they may need to prioritise policies that foster entrepreneurship and the creation of new businesses.
4.	Society: The discoveries may have far-reaching consequences for society at large, perhaps affecting national or regional economic growth and development. There may be beneficial repercussions for the local community and society at large if, for instance, the study reveals that startups are more numerous in a certain location.

Value of the Analysis:
1.	This approach may reveal how economic growth affects worker behaviour. Policymakers, business leaders, and people should understand how economic development and employment possibilities affect behaviour.
2.	This study might help politicians create jobs and start businesses. Knowing the elements that affect startup prevalence and job-seekers' mindsets should help policymakers boost new enterprises and sectors.
3.	This approach might assist corporate management understand employee preferences and motivations. In industrialised nations, job-oriented attitudes may need firms to give more stable and secure jobs to attract and retain people (Kurniawan et al., 2020).
4.	This study might assist people make professional selections and understand their work behaviour. Entrepreneurship may appeal to them if they reside in a startup-friendly nation.
This approach may illuminate the complicated link between economic growth and human working behaviour and guide individual, corporate, and government policy.
